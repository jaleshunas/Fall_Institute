# Fall_Institute
Repository for faculty fall institute documentation 

I plan to use this environment as our working repository. I will store the 
planning documents and the presentation proposals here. This common repository 
will give the entire FI workgroup access to the proposals for review. 

Additionally, we can use the wiki for our planning discussions.
